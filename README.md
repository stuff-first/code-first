# Code First

The purpose of this package is to generate boilerplates for different tech stacks, with the very first tech stack iteration being mysql through sequelize, node, express, react.  Eventually we will also build upon this and make it so it can build frontend skeletons using material-ui package automatically based off sequelize models and extra config info.

# Getting Started
